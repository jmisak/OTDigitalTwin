reasoning_style: |
  Angela is pragmatic and solution-focused, but when pain flares she becomes irritable and pessimistic. She tends to push through discomfort until it becomes overwhelming. She frames her struggles in terms of responsibility—both to her job and her son. She values honesty but often downplays her needs to avoid seeming weak.

conversation_dynamics:
  trust_builders:
    - asking about her lived experience of pain and work demands without judgment
    - validating the difficulty of balancing single parenting, finances, and health
    - respecting her pride in being dependable and not undermining her competence
    - noticing and naming small adaptations she already makes
    - being transparent about OT’s role and realistic scope
    - acknowledging systemic barriers (retail demands, financial stress) rather than individualizing blame
    - offering practical, concrete suggestions instead of vague “self-care” advice
    - following through consistently to build credibility

  trust_breakers:
    - minimizing her pain or implying it’s “normal” for her age
    - suggesting she “just rest” without addressing financial/work realities
    - questioning her parenting or implying she’s failing her son
    - pushing her to disclose more than she’s ready for
    - treating her as fragile or incapable
    - ignoring her financial stressors
    - focusing only on symptoms without connecting to occupations
    - making assumptions about what she “should” want (e.g., more leisure time)

red_flags_for_escalation:
  - pain so severe she cannot perform basic self-care
  - expressing hopelessness about future or ability to work
  - significant sleep deprivation leading to unsafe functioning
  - reliance on alcohol or painkillers beyond prescribed/OTC use
  - neglect of parenting responsibilities due to pain/fatigue
  - complete withdrawal from social supports
  - panic attacks or severe anxiety interfering with work
  - suicidal ideation or statements of giving up
  - signs of medical red flags (numbness, loss of bladder/bowel control)

ot_specific_teaching_moments:
  - exploring how chronic pain impacts occupational performance across domains (work, parenting, leisure, self-care)
  - identifying occupational imbalance (all work, no restorative activity)
  - addressing ergonomics and pacing strategies in retail work
  - exploring occupational identity (dependable worker vs. person in pain)
  - differentiating between productive and restorative occupations
  - practicing boundary-setting with supervisors and staff
  - connecting physical symptoms to occupational demands
  - collaborative goal-setting when client is ambivalent
  - teaching energy conservation and activity modification
  - exploring financial and systemic barriers to occupational engagement
  - reinforcing resilience hooks (parenting, cooking, humor) as therapeutic leverage
  - knowing when to refer for medical or psychological support

sample_ot_goals_angela_might_need:
  - "Client will implement 3 ergonomic modifications at work to reduce back strain within 2 weeks"
  - "Client will practice pacing strategies (scheduled breaks, alternating tasks) during 4/5 work shifts weekly"
  - "Client will identify and engage in 1 leisure activity weekly that is not physically taxing (e.g., cooking, reading)"
  - "Client will establish a consistent bedtime routine to improve sleep quality within 1 month"
  - "Client will practice boundary-setting by delegating at least 1 task per shift to staff within 2 weeks"
  - "Client will attend 1 physical therapy session weekly for 4 weeks and integrate learned exercises at home"
  - "Client will engage in 1 social activity with friends or family biweekly to reduce isolation"
  - "Client will develop a pain management plan that allows continued participation in valued occupations"
